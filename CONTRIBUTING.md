# Contributing to loop-and-gate-grow-kit

Thanks for wanting to help. This kit is a judgment layer for taking software to
market with an agentic loop — a grow-gates reference
(`reference/grow-gates.md`), the `grow-and-gate` operating skill, and a few
templates. Contributions that keep it terse and runnable are very welcome.

## Reporting bugs

Open a [bug report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) issue. Include your
Claude Code version, install method (clone or plugin), OS, and the exact steps
plus any error output.

Never paste credentials, tokens, or private vault contents into an issue. For
anything security-sensitive, follow [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md) instead
of opening a public issue.

## Proposing gate or skill changes

The grow gates live in `reference/grow-gates.md` and the operating skill in
`skills/grow-and-gate/`. Before proposing a change:

1. **Open a feature request first** for anything non-trivial, so the design can
   be discussed before you write it. Small fixes (a typo, a broken link, a
   clarified checklist item) can go straight to a PR.
2. **Match the existing style.** The gates are terse and grouped by cadence
   (strategy / per-piece / feedback), one decision each. Keep additions in that
   form — no speculative structure.
3. **Keep changes surgical.** Touch only what the change needs.

### The gates are the asset

The whole point of this kit is that the loop *stops* at a fixed set of
human-decision points — is the design actually yours, is the claim true, is this
your audience, is it worth shipping now. **Pull requests that remove a gate,
auto-approve one, or otherwise let the agent skip the human will be declined.**
That is not a bug in the workflow — it is the workflow. Tightening a gate's
wording, adding a missing check, or clarifying when a gate is earned is exactly
the kind of change we want; deleting the human from the loop is not. If you think
a gate genuinely needs to change, open an issue and make the case first.

## Pull request conventions

- **Branch names:** `feature/<short-desc>`, `fix/<short-desc>`, or
  `chore/<short-desc>`.
- **Commits:** [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) —
  `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`. Small, atomic
  commits.
- **Scope:** one concern per PR. Keep the diff as small as the change allows.
- **Docs:** update the README or reference docs in the same PR as the change.
